Hi! ðŸ‘‹ 
my name Juliana. Iâ€™m a dentist that fell in love with data during my university years, and since then worked with it 
in the public health field.

As I have a curious mind and wish to expand my knowledge. I started to study Data Science in an intensive boot camp at
All women, where I developed some new skills:
- programming in Python;
- prepare the data;
- perform exploratory data analysis;
- machine learning models (supervised and unsupervised algorithms);
- NLP (sentiment analysis, topic-modeling, web scraping);
- SQL. 

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in change for a Data Science career!
